== Description ==

= Introduction =

**Customizable notifications delivery by text message (SMS), email and voice(text-to-speech)**, for the administrator as well as for clients, when there is an event in WooCommerce, such as a new order or order completed.

This module helps both the administrator and the client keep a safer track of what is the current status of an order, as it **sends notifications automatically by SMS, email and voice calls**.

You can customize the **notifications for every status order**: *Pending, On-Hold, Processing, Completed, Cancelled, Refunded, Failed*

You can use custom **variables in the messages** to provide useful information as: *{order_status}, {order_id}, {order_amount} or {shop_name}*

Afilnet's service allow you to keep in touch with your client, which means:

* You will always be able to **access your information inmediately** in you mobile phone.
* There is **no need of check your store's user account** in order to be updated about everything that happens to your orders.
* **The administrator will be updated** about everything that happens in their store, like when there is a new registration or when a payment is confirmed.
* **The client can be easily kept posted** about the status of their order.
